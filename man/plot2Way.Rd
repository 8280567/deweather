\title{Plot two-way interactions from gbm model}
\usage{
plot2Way(dat, variable = c("ws", "temp"), res = 100, exlude = TRUE,
  cols = "default", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Model object from running \code{buildMod}.}

\item{variable}{The variables to plot. Must be of length two
e.g. \code{variables = c("ws", "wd"}.}

\item{res}{Resolution in x-y i.e. number of points in each dimension.}

\item{exlude}{Should surfaces exlude predictions too far from
original data? The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cols}{Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
\dQuote{default}, \dQuote{increment}, \dQuote{heat}, \dQuote{jet}
and user defined. For user defined the user can supply a list of
colour names recognised by R (type \code{colours()} to see the
full list). An example would be \code{cols = c("yellow", "green",
"blue")}}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed for plotting.}
